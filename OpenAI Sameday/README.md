# Sameday tutorial

This simple project demonstrates the integration of Next.js and Python for creating virtual sales agents. Follow these straightforward steps to set up and run the project:

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Getting Started with Next.js

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the Next.js directory and run the following command to install the necessary Node.js modules:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Next.js Application**: After the dependencies are installed, start the Next.js application by running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Your Next.js application should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Getting Started with Python

1. **Install Python Requirements**: Navigate to the Python directory and install the required Python packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Python Application**: Execute the Python script to use the virtual sales agents:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The Python application will run and interact with the virtual sales agents.

That's it! You're all set to create and use virtual sales agents with Next.js and Python. If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation for each technology or contact the project's maintainers for assistance. Enjoy working with your AI-driven virtual sales agents!
