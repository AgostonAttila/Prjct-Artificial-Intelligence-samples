Official implementation of **[StoryDiffusion: Consistent Self-Attention for Long-Range Image and Video Generation]()**.

### **Demo Video**

### Update History

You can visit [here](update.md) to visit update history.

### ðŸŒ   **Key Features:**
StoryDiffusion can create a magic story by generating consistent images and videos. Our work mainly has two parts: 
1. Consistent self-attention for character-consistent image generation over long-range sequences. It is hot-pluggable and compatible with all SD1.5 and SDXL-based image diffusion models. For the current implementation, the user needs to provide at least 3 text prompts for the consistent self-attention module. We recommend at least 5 - 6 text prompts for better layout arrangement.
2. Motion predictor for long-range video generation, which predicts motion between Condition Images in a compressed image semantic space, achieving larger motion prediction. 



## ðŸ”¥ **Examples**


### Comics generation

### Image-to-Video generation ï¼ˆResults are HIGHLY compressed for speedï¼‰
Leveraging the images produced through our Consistent Self-Attention mechanism, we can extend the process to create videos by seamlessly transitioning between these images. This can be considered as a two-stage long video generation approach.

Note: results are **highly compressed** for speed, you can visit [our website](https://storydiffusion.github.io/) for the high-quality version.
#### Two-stage Long Videos Generation (New Update)
Combining the two parts, we can generate very long and high-quality AIGC videos.

#### Long Video Results using Condition Images
Our Image-to-Video model can generate a video by providing a sequence of user-input condition images.

# ðŸ”§ Dependencies and Installation

- Python >= 3.8 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
- [PyTorch >= 2.0.0](https://pytorch.org/)
```bash
conda create --name storydiffusion python=3.10
conda activate storydiffusion
pip install -U pip

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# How to use

Currently, we provide two ways for you to generate comics.

## Use the jupyter notebook

You can open the `Comic_Generation.ipynb` and run the code.

## Start a local gradio demo
Run the following command:

```python
python gradio_app_sdxl_specific_id.py
```

**(Recommend)** We provide a low GPU Memory cost version, it was tested on a machine with 24GB GPU-memory(Tesla A10) and 30GB RAM, and expected to work well with >20 G GPU-memory.

```python
python gradio_app_sdxl_specific_id_low_vram.py
```
