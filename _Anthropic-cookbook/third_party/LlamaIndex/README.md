# LlamaIndex <> Anthropic Cookbooks

[LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) is a data framework for LLM-based applications that benefit from context augmentation.

Here we provide cookbooks for building LLM applications using Anthropic and LlamaIndex.

1. `Basic_RAG_With_LlamaIndex.ipynb` - Notebook to help you build RAG pipelines with LlamaIndex.
2. `Router_Query_Engine.ipynb` - Notebook to help you use `RouterQueryEngine` to route user queries to different indices.
3. `SubQuestion_Query_Engine` - Notebook to help you to use `SubQuestionQueryEngine` to answer complex user queries spanning multiple documents.
4. `ReAct_Agent.ipynb` - Notebook to help you to use `ReActAgent` for using Tools and QueryEngine Tools.
5.  `Multi_Document_Agents.ipynb` - Notebook to help you build an efficient RAG pipeline for a large number of documents.
6.  `Multi_Modal.ipynb` - Notebook to help you build Multi-Modal applications using LlamaIndex.
